        // now we have to get the element (above div) and render map in that (create a map layer in it):

        const map = L.map("map").setView([31.349444989902047, 48.68678593436888], 17)

        // L is an object which references to Leaflet => access to all methods & classes in leaflet 
        // "map" is the id of the <div>

        // L.map("map") => just creates a map without anything to show 
        // .setView([31.349444989902047, 48.68678593436888], 17) => here we define the place which we want the map to show 
        // 17 => 1 till 18 => its about zooming :D 


        // now we should load the tiles of the map:

        L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png').addTo(map)        
        // Every map is made up of a series of square pieces (layers - tiled image layers) put together. 
        // its not like it's a complete picture. It's a series of square pieces (tiled image layer) put together.
        // all maps are made up of all the squares put together and that map is created, like Google Maps.

        // here we use openstreatmap api to load the tiled image layers
